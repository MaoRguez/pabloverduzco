Hello amigos, my name is Pablo. I'm a software engineer based in Guadalajara, Mexico and I build things that lives in internet. I feel highly motivated for front-end web development but I do enjoy back-end development as well and I'm always willing and able to collaborate with others. I never stop learning new things even if it is a mistake I made. My goal as a front-end web developer is create incredible websites or applications but at the same time accessible to everyone. When I'm not coding or studying I usually like to spend time in hobbies, friends or family.

Here are **some** of the technologies I use on my daily:
- HTML
- CSS
  - SCSS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
  - Node.js
- Git
